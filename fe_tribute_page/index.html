          <h3>A brief introduction to Rita Levi Montalcini biography</h3>
          <p>
              Levi-Montalcini was born on 22 April 1909 in Turin, to a Sephardi Jewish family. She and her
              twin sister Paola were the youngest of four children. Her parents were Adele Montalcini, a painter, and
              Adamo Levi, an electrical engineer and mathematician.
          </p>
          <p>
              In her teenage years, she considered becoming a writer and admired Swedish writer Selma Lagerl√∂f, but
              after seeing a close family friend die of stomach cancer she decided to attend the University of
              Turin Medical School.
          </p>
          <p>
              Her father discouraged his daughters from attending college, as he feared it
              would disrupt their potential lives as wives and mothers, but eventually he supported Levi-Montalcini's
              aspirations to become a doctor.
          </p>
          <p>
              While at the University of Turin, the neurohistologist Giuseppe Levi sparked her interest in the
              developing nervous system.
          </p>
          <p>
              After graduating with a summa cum laude M.D.
              in 1936 she remained at the university as Levi's assistant, but her academic career was cut short by
              Benito Mussolini's 1938 Manifesto of Race and the subsequent introduction of laws barring Jews from
              academic and professional careers.
